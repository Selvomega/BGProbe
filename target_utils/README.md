# `target_utils` readme

This module defines the toolbox may be used to interact with the routing softwares.

Currently we only consider calling this on the same host machine with the routing software.

## TODOs:

- Interfaces to configure the software. 
- Interfaces supporting multiple different softwares.
- Interfaces to check the log of the software or monitor the status of the software.
